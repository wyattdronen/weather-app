Weather app API

This application has:
* a weather dashboard with form inputs to search for a city
* presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* view current weather conditions for that city and be presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature,    the humidity, and the wind speed.
* a 5-day forcast that displays the date
* uses local storage and event listener to store previous searches.

## API and Boostrap 
This weather application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for cities. It also uses Bootstrap for basic styling and layout. I have used localStorage and event listeners to save previous search queries. The variables used for the API to fetch are exact to the APIs var names. 

## Citation 
This repo was cited for using local storage and event listeners to store previous searches and display a 5-day forecast. I also refered to this for setting up bootstrap and how to format.
